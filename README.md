SPARQ, aka the Spotify Party Queue, is:
A web based interface that turns a user's Spotify queue into a priority queue.
To be used at parties or other large gatherings, where people may complain about
the hosts music choices. 

The host can choose to "create a party", sign in with their Spotify premium
account, and then set a unique identifying name. Anyone else can then choose to
"join a party" using the same identifying name. Once you have joined a party,
you can see the songs currently in the queue, along with a fallback playlist set
by the host.

You can then search Spotify's vast song base to add songs to the queue, or vote
for/against songs already in the queue. The more votes a song has, the higher in
the queue it moves. If a song hits a negative value set by the host (default 5?)
then the song is automatically removed. The host alone of the party can manually
remove songs from the list, control the volume, pause/play songs, and force
songs to play immediately.
