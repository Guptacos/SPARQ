Figure out how to get permission and use the Spotify API
    Making it secure so that people can log in without having their info stolen
    restricting access when someone "joins a party" 
        they shouldn't be able to see or modify the user's songs, history, or 
        playlists
    How to search their song database
    How to create a queue
    Might be easier to implement the queue on our end, and we only send the next
        song information to Spotify when it's been finalized?
            maybe set a 5 second cap. When song is 5 sec from finishing,
            whatever the next song in our queue is, that's the song getting sent
            to Spotify's servers.

Pick a language to use - probably Python, maybe Javascript/HTML?

How are we going to actually code the UI that loads on the site? 
    Javascript/HTML? Eugene this is you

How to host: look into Github's free website hosting service

Features to Implement
-Home screen
-Join/create party
    -secure database to hold information about current parties
        -information like: how many people in party, who host is, IP of people,
         queue


Issues: 
-What if someone reloads the page? How to stop them from re-voting?
    Maybe can use cookies or IP address?

TODO:
-Start with home screen and connecting 1 user's spotify
-Be able to search songs
-Implement a priority queue and have it be able to play song's on the user's
    device
-Allow people to "join a party
-Allow multiple parties to be hosted - multithreading?
-Encryption
